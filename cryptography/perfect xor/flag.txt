The function a(n) suggests use about the perfect number where the sum of the divisors of the number is the number itself.

we had to figure out the first 14 perfect numbers.

while the first 1 numbers are available everywhere, the task was to find 11-14 perfect nos. the wikipedia article shows incomplete numbers but gives us a number p which can be used to find the next 4 perfect nos. as i have done in flag.py.
