the challenge provides a pcap file and the name of the challenge suggests ICMP.

clearly seeing the ICMP traffic, we see that a PNG image file has been sent over the network.

More research shows that only 16B can be sent in a packet at a time and rest is repeated.

we transferred the request packets only from the request/reply conversation to a JSON file from which we can extract the data.[icmpreqjson.json]

Since the image is PNG we can google the header starter and find 16B from there to output to a FILE using our pythons script.[flag.py]

script gives us the data in HEX of the PNG image.[hexoutput.txt]

Use hexed.it to make it a PNG file and export.[hex1.png]
